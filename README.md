time-lord
---------
The ruby gem `time-lord` gives extra (needed) methods to the ruby `time` class.
Originally started as gem that gave dwevelopers the `time-ago-in-words` method for the `time` class.
It evolved into a multi-part boost to the `Time` class.


*postscript* This gem was previously called "time-ago-in-words".
I changed this, obviously.
